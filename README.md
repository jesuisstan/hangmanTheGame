## Foreword:
This is my very first project written in vanilla Javascript. It is a small console-game. The project demonstrates basic knoledgement on working with variables, input/output (prompt()), strings, loops and conditions.

### What is this game about?
Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A computer hides a word from user, which user tries to guess letter by letter. If user fails, he'll be “hanged”. If user wins, he'll survive. A user have 8 attempts to guess a hidden word. Every time a user guesses a wrong letter, he loses one attempt.
